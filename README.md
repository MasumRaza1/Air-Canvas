# Air-Canvas
Air Canvas is an interactive application that allows users to draw digital art simply by waving their finger in the air. The project was developed as a semester project for a programming course using Python3, OpenCV, and Numpy.<br>

## Getting Started

To get started with Air Canvas, you'll need to have Python3, OpenCV, and Numpy installed on your system. Once you have those dependencies installed, you can run the `air_canvas.py` file to launch the application.<br>

## Usage

To use Air Canvas, the user must have a colored marker, such as a pen or highlighter, and a camera. The application will track the movement of the marker and convert it into digital art on the screen.<br><br>

To draw, simply wave the marker in the air while in front of the camera. The color of the marker will be detected and used to draw on the canvas.<br>

## Team

This project was developed by a team of three students. The programmer lead was responsible for coordinating the development of the application and implementing key features.<br>
